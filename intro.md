### Analysing the Likert Scale of **Computer Supported Strategic Planning @ UNAM**
Carlos Rodriguez, PhD
### Introduction
This app is developed to analyse a Likert scale answered by 39 people (grouped in six groups of approximately seven members each) which participated in an social experiment to prove whether the Balanced Scorecard (method applied in the three Experimental Groups, coded **BSC**) is better tool in designing business plans, than the traditional method (the method used by the three Control Groups, coded **HO**).

At the end of the groups task, each member was asked to answer the Likert scale. The scale contains 40 Likert items classified in six hypothetical constructs.

This app allows to analyse each Likert item, which can be selected from the side panel. For example **item 1 construct 1** is the item 1 of the construct 1. The text of each item can be viewed in the **Item Text** tab of the app.

For each Likert item, a **chi squared** test is executed, the summary can be viewed in the **summary** tab, and a Likert graphic can be seen in the **Plot** tab of the app. The crosstab can also be viewed in the **Cross Tab** tab.
