# Developing Data Products
## Final **shiny** project
## Carlos Rodriguez Contreras
This repository is created for the first requirement of the **Developing Data Products** course, part of the **Data Science Specialization** at the **Johns Hopkins University - Coursera**.

The repository contains the next files:

1. **ui.R** which defines the user interface of the app.

2. **server.R** which executes all R code needed.

3. **README.md** this text. 

For this **shiny** app to function, three files are downloaded from the **server.R**:

1. **theIntro.html** which is an html file containing the introduction to the app.

2. **likertscale.csv** which is the database with the responses to the Likert scale analysed.

3. **itemstext.scv** which is the file with the text of each Likert item.
